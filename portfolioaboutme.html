        <h1>Hi, my name is Wes.</h1>
        <p>I like to read, analyze movies, play with my cats, and do adventure riding on my motorcycle.</p>
        <p>I also like to <code>code</code></p>
        <p>A long time ago in an office far, far away, I created a VBA script to solve an administrative problem. I pressed the play button and watched in wonderment as my computer crunched a two-hour task in a few seconds. From that moment, I was hopelessly, irrevocably hooked on using code to make computers do things.</p>
